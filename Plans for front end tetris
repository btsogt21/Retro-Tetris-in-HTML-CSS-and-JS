Plans for Front-End Tetris:

July 24th:



Maybe split fucntionality of bricking up blocked tetrominoes and checking if the tetromino has room to move to the next row. This could help fix some of the concurrency issues we are dealing with.

Consider using something other than setInterval to move the tetrominoes. 

Figure out where the fuck the VM calls are coming from.


Aug 28th:

Month break from everything, need to not do that anymore.

Figured out where the VM calls were coming from. I had two script tags where I was importing the tetrisapp.js in my index.html. This was causing the second instance of the game to happen. Keep an eye out for anything else as we still had more on our list of potential causes.

Sep 31st-Sep 1st:

Worked on since last commit:

	Implemented left-right movement and boundary collision using Eventlistener and custom functions. Need to implement something to make sure that the continuous movement that comes with long-presses of the left/right buttons is not interrupted by presses of unused keys in game.

	Hid the spawn zone again.
	
Sep 7th:

	- Need to implement delay between impact between current block and 'solidified' layers and solidification of current block (time for player to maneuver/rotate a couple last times)
	
	- Need to implement rotation, right way to do this?
	
	- Implement something where fast moving down (not instant) and fast moving sideways can be done at the same time.
